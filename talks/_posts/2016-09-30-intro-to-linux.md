This presentation provides a quick overview of the history of Linux, what exactly Linux even is, and what all the hype is. It also provides a light introduction to the concept of distributions and desktop environments, and also explains how you can get your first experience working with Linux. May or may not also contain a rare exclusive by Hannah Montana. And perhaps Pok√©mon gym badges.
