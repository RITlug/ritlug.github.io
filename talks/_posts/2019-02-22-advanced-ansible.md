Maybe you heard of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) before or maybe you already use it.
Once you get the basics of writing a playbook, what else can you do?
This talk covers two use cases of Ansible:

* For personal use: Configuring personal Linux workstations
* For professional use: Managing configurations for different applications

Learn more about how to supercharge your Ansible skills in practice.
How do you begin to scale an Ansible project with more than one person?
How can you easily reuse code so you don't repeat yourself?
This talk explained how to do these things based on personal experience of managing infrastructure over six months.
