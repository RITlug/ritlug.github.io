RITlug is proud to present our keynote on everything you ever wanted to know about lamps. From picking the right type of stand, a light bulb of the right wattage, and interior decorating design, we cover all angles.

Okay, not that kind of lamp. LAMP stands for "Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP". A LAMP stack is a common web server configuration used in the world of web infrastructure. This talk walks you through what exactly all the different pieces of LAMP are, what you can do with them, and how you can get to work on building a stack of your very own. This talk also includes a variety of alternates too, including nginx and PostgreSQL. Learn how and then some in our LAMP presentation!
