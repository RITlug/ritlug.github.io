This talk goes over creating a Minecraft server using the open source Spigot server software. It shows how to compile Spigot, set up an environment on a remote server, and configuring and setting up the basics.

If you've ever wanted to host a Minecraft server with your friends or try building a community, these slides show you how Linux enables you to easily deploy a Minecraft server or network of servers.
