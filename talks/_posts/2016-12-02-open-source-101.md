RITlug is proud to present our final presentation for the Fall 2016 semester: Open Source 101! This meeting covered various aspects of open source, including a brief introduction, coverage of common tools and development practices, and how to engage in open source software. This meeting also had guest speakers Dan Schneiderman from the RIT MAGIC Center and Professor Stephen Jacobs from IGM talk about open source beyond code, the role of patents and licensing, and more.

This is a great introduction to open source and contains some helpful tips before starting your own open source journey.
