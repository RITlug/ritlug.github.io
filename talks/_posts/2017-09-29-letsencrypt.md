Are your dreams haunted by a world without encryption? Do you envision a world of madness without HTTPS? RITlug has the answer to put away your nightmares.

Join us today, Friday, Sept. 29th, from 4pm to 6pm to encrypt ALL the things with free SSL/TLS certificates from LetsEncrypt! Learn what LetsEncrypt is all about and how you can use it to generate your own certificates for free.

This week’s session is being delivered as a talk, but if you want to follow along during the workshop, make sure you bring a laptop with you.
