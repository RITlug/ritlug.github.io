*RITlug hosts weekly meetings every week of classes at RIT. Meetings are {{ site.ritlug-day }}s {{ site.ritlug-time }} in {{ site.ritlug-place }}.*

The RIT Linux Users Group is an RIT-sponsored club for new and experienced users of the [Linux operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). Although our main focus is Linux, we often discuss other topics in [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and alternative operating systems like [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution).

Our meeting format is typically a presentation or workshop followed by open discussion. Meeting topics and summaries will be posted on the website weekly.

We're always open to suggestions for future meetings. If you'd like to contact us for any reason, send an email to <a href="#" id="our-email" data-mail="ritlug">(needs JavaScript)</a><script>(function(){var e=document.getElementById('our-email');e.innerHTML=e.dataset.mail+'@rit.edu';e.href='mailto:'+e.innerHTML})()</script>.

RITlug also has a largely open-source governance process. Most of RITlug's governing documents are available on Github and accept contributions. If you're a RITlug member who thinks there's something we can do better, let us know or submit a pull request.
