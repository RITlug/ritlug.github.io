The RIT Linux Users Group is a student-led organization to contribute to and engage students in [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) &amp; [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). We are an RIT-sponsored club for new and experienced users alike. Although our main focus is Linux, we also discuss other topics such as digital privacy and alternative operating systems like [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution).

Our meeting format is typically a presentation or workshop followed by open discussion. Meeting topics and summaries will be posted on the website weekly.

We're always open to suggestions for future meetings. If you'd like to contact us for any reason, send an email to {{ site.email }}.

RITlug also has a largely open-source governance process. Most of RITlug's governing documents are available on Github and accept contributions. If you're a RITlug member who thinks there's something we can do better, let us know or submit a pull request.
