Hello RITLUG!
Solomon is super busy this week but asked me to let you all know that RITLUG is still on. As this is an odd number week we will have discussion time.
The floor will be open for discussion of any topic or news in Linux, FOSS or jsut generally cool, geeky stuff and I am personally hoping to give a progress update on TigerOS in the run up to Imagine. 
Hope to see you there!


#### Don't forget! 

You can find RITlug this year in a variety of places, but the best ways to keep in touch with the club are via our Telegram group and/or the IRC channel. The bridge bot between the two keeps the chats synchronized nicely. The conversations are active every day and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to professional work and co-op advice. You can also find us on Facebook as well.
