Hey RITlug!

This week's talk is all about Ansible, an automation tool that can
configure systems, deploy software, and much more. If you've ever wondered how
to orchestrate thousands of Linux servers, this meeting is for you!

This week's presentation will kick off around 5pm, and is led by
Justin Wheeler (jwheel).


See you then,
-- Tim Zabel (Tjzabel)
