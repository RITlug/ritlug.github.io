Hey all! 

This week we'll have a talk from Freya about homelabbing. As always, we'll meet in GOL-1445 at 4:30pm this Friday. 

Remember, next week is Lightning Talks! Anyone can come and give a 5-ish minute talk on any topic they're interested in (even if it's not directly Linux related, although that's certainly fine too). 

See you there!
