Howdy Luggers!

We want to apologize for the late email. In the following weeks we will be sending out our weekly email on Tuesdays. Keep an eye out for them!

This week we're excited to bring you an intro to Linux. We'll be looking at what Linux actually is as well as a breif history of it and of course why you should use it! We'll also talk about the different components of it such as the Kernel and higher level items such as various Linux Distributions.

We hope to see you tomorrow to start exploring!


####  tl;dr 

* Time/date: Friday, Sept 8th, 2017, 4pm - 6pm (**GOL/70-2650**)
* Talk:      Linux 101

#### Come say hello to us!

Conversations are active daily and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to co-op advice to random topics. You can also find us on Facebook as well (but not much is happening there!).
