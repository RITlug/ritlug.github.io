This week we will be having Lightning Talks for the semester! As usual, we will be meeting in GOL-2455 from 4:30-6:00pm. As a reminder, speakers will have approximately 5-10 minutes to give a presentation on anything they choose (that is school appropriate). 

Also, this week we will be selling stickers! They are on a first-come, first-serve basis while we have some available. The price is whatever you would like - if you want to just take some stickers, go ahead, but if you have the capability to donate a few dollars to the club, it would be much appreciated. (We need to fulfill our budget request obligations for this past year, a whole 10 dollars!)

Hope to see everyone there!
