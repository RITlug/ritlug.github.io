Hi all! This week, Rose will be talking about low-level programming. As usual, we'll
meet from 4:30 - 6:00 PM in GOL-1445

Also, this semester's **lightning talks** will take place on **November 21st**, two weeks
from today! Anyone can come with a short (5-10 minute) talk about anything they want --
whether it be about Linux or anything (really, *anything*) else you're passionate about.
Lightning talks can be as serious or unserious as you want. No need to sign up, just come
to our meeting in the 21st with your talk ready!

See you all there!
