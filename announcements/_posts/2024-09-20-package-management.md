Hello everyone!

If you're new to Linux, you probably want to know how to install software. If you're not, then maybe you've wondered how that software gets from a source repository on the developer's computer, to being a binary on your computer. 

Either way, join us tomorrow at 4:30PM in Golisano 2455 for my presentation about package management
