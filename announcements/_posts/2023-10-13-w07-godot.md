Hey all! This week we'll be having a talk from Julian about Godot and FOSS game development. As always, we'll meet this Friday in GOL-1445 at 4:30 pm. 

If you ordered merch and are paying in cash, it is highly preferred that you get it to us some time before or during this meeting.

See you there!
