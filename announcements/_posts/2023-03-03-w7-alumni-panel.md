Hi RITluggers,

This week, in preparation for the upcoming career fair we will be having a RITlug alumni panel. Stop on by to talk to old friends about their experiences getting jobs, and working both on co-op and full time. This will be on Friday at 4:30-6:00pm in GOL-2455. Additionally, we will be having an online career panel this Saturday at 11am EST for those who can't make it in person (feel free to come to both!).

Additionally, please fill out this form for what types of things you'd like our panelists to talk about: https://pad.ryan77627.xyz/form/#/2/form/view/BgNAPNzjCkKi+Ihkftfij91bgLAjdWo3z61CCrBH2wc/

Finally, if you'd be interested in buying merch later in the semester, please fill out our merch interest form: https://forms.gle/K5BoHzqUeoLN5vAv6 . This isn't a commitment, just letting us gauge approximately how many people would like merch, and what kinds of merch have demand.

See you all on Friday,
Penguin Supreme
