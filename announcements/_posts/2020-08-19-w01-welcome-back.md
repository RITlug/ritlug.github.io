Hello RITlug,

Welcome back to RIT! We are glad to have you all back again this semester, even if you are not necessarily on campus. This semester we are going to be doing things a bit differently. Meetings will still be held Fridays from 4:30-6:00pm, however they will be conducted on our new [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/xev2W62). You can still reach out on the Slack channel, however this semester we will be primarily moving over to Discord. 

The meeting this Friday we will be holding a quick meet and greet with eboard and the other members of the club on the Discord. It will be a great way to catch up with everybody from last semester as well as meet some new members and learn about everybody's favorite things regarding Linux.

Also be sure to stop by the RITlug table at the Club fair this weekend from 12:00pm - 3:00pm on Saturday and Sunday.

We look forward to seeing you all soon!

Sincerely,
The RITlug eboard
