Hi everyone!

As the semester begins to warp up I am pleased to announce a number of things taking place in the very near future!


###### Lightning Talks
First and foremost, this weeks talk! We'll be having a first for RITlug (at least a first in the last few years). This week is lightning talks! We'll be hearing talks on various subjects relating to Linux (perhaps only vaguely in some cases) from several members. **If you would like to give a lightning talk this friday please just come ready with something to present on, we'll make sure there's time for you.** Among those confirmed are Josh Bicking, Adian Kahrs, and Allison Fox. I hope to see more people show up ready to give a talk too!

###### Elections
Next up, Elections. It is in fact that time of year! We'll be starting the nomination process this week. Very simply, if you would like to run for Eboard next year you can nomiate yourself with this form [https://goo.gl/forms/6VTNhHeuDcOIMWyW2](https://goo.gl/forms/6VTNhHeuDcOIMWyW2). Nominations will close on Wednesday April 26th at 12pm, please be sure to get your nominations in by then. Elections will then be held (online) starting that Friday, more info will be released as elections get closer.

###### A Personal Nomination
Proudly, I want to announce a group nomination for RITlug Eboard. 

There has been a lot of changes to RITlug this year that took Justin and I by surpise. Between unexpected Co-ops and a semester abroad, there was a lot to juggle. I'd say that we managed. **But we want to do better.** For this coming year I'm proud to nominate Justin Flory as President of RITlug, myself as Vice President, Taylor Bowling as Treasurer, Allison Fox as Secretary,and Aidan Kahrs as our Project Coordinator. Above all else, we want to make sure that our 2017-2018 year is smooth and organized. Most importantly, we feel it's important that our weekly talks and discussions times are consistent and predetermined (We want a schedule of talks and disussions that's known ahead of time). The other big item that we want focus on is projects and workshops. Hand on work is the best kind of work. This semester we piloted projects; this coming year we want to expand that to not only projects but also hands on workshops every few weeks. 

In short, This year, Justin and I feel that we started to transform RITlug into a more open and interactive group. Next year we want to continue that transition and continue to see our community grow and thrive! On be half of Justin, Taylor, Allison, Aidan, and myself, we hope you'll join us in our vision for RITlug.

###### Imagine RIT
In just a few short weeks is Imagine RIT! If you weren't aware, every year RIT hosts an amazing innovation fair and every year RITlug joins in the fun! We'll be seated at our own table in the Magic Center with Free and Open Source Software @ RIT. This year we'll be showcasing not just one but three magic mirrors, several Raspberry Pi's, and TigerOS! Along with all of our cool projects, we want to show all of our Imagine guests that Linux is awesome. Please stop by and visit our booth on May 6th, all day long!


How's that for a jam-packed email? 

##### FOSS Hours!
And lastly, don't forget about FOSS hours every Wednesday from **4pm-6pm in GOL-2500**! It's a great time to network, get help, or just relax with FOSSy/RITlug friends.

Next week we'll be having a guest speaker - see my previous email for more info!
