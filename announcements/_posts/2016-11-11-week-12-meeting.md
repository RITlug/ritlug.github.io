Hey RITluggers!

Unfortunately, the meeting today is canceled due to last-minute travel changes, where I will not be able to be present farther into Friday evening. Since this cancellation is sudden and also since next week is the last week before Thanksgiving break, this week's meeting will be moved to Friday, November 18th, 2016 at the usual time (4pm - 6pm). I am hoping to make next week's talk an introduction to open source communities, how students can get involved, and also some of the other cool open source things happening on campus. We may also have a guest speaker next week as well!
