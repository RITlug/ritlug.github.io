Hi RITlug!

Welcome to Week 13.
Join us this week for a guest presentation from [Jason Carr](https://gitlab.com/jcarr0) on **cross-distribution packaging**.

Jason will discuss the problems and difficulties with existing package managers on Linux.
Two solutions have come about:

1. Bundled application managers
2. Improved package managers

Additionally, Jason will give a comparison of bundled applications: **Snap**, **Flatpak**, and **AppImage**.
He will also talk about the cross-distro package managers **Nix** and **Guix**.

We hope to see you at this week's meeting.
If you aren't in our Slack already, don't forget to come and say hello!

Cheers,
- Justin Wheeler (jwheel)
