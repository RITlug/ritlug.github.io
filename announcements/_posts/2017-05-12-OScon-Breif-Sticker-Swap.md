Howdy folks!

This week has been a very exciting week in the FOSS@RIT world. Allison and I, as well as several other students, had the privilege of representing RIT at Oreily's Open Source convention in Austin, TX. On Friday we will be talking about our experiences in the form of an informal briefing (read: story telling) and sharing the massive amounts of swag we've picked up (mostly stickers). As it's our final week and finals are around the corner, I understand that attendance will be a bit hard. Feel free to just stop by for a few minutes and pick up some stickers!

Good luck on finals! And have an **awesome** summer!
