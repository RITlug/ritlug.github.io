Hello Linux Users
We're just a week away from Spring break and thank god for that. Given that many of us have travel plans, myself included, we wont be having a meeting this week. However I encourage project groups to get together to continue work.

Although we wont have RITlug, we still will have our Raspberry Pi Group Meeting! This message is directly from Taylor:

Hello! Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who attended last week's RITLUG Raspberry Pi meeting, everything was very well received! This week we will be doing a workshop focusing on using BerryBoot to put multiple Linux distributions onto your Pi. As a reminder, the meeting is held in Golisano 2650 from 6:30 to 7:30PM.

Feel free to bring your own Pi if you're interested in following along with the workshop, but just as a note you will need a VGA to HDMI or DVI to HDMI converter in order to use your Pi with the monitors in the lab.

If you don't have a Pi, or don't have a video converter, fear not! We have Pi's and video converters available for you to borrow for the course of the workshop. If you'd like to take advantage of this, and we hope you do, we just ask that you use this form to reserve materials beforehand: https://goo.gl/forms/lplukkXmhtd5O1sS2. We look forward to seeing you all on Wednesday!



And lastly, don't forget about FOSS hours every Wednesday from **4pm-6pm in GOL-2500**! It's a great time to network, get help, or just relax with FOSSy friends.

Looking forward to seeing every one Friday! Good luck tomorrow if you've got interviews!

You can find RITlug this year in a variety of places, but the best ways to keep in touch with the club are via our Telegram group and/or the IRC channel. The bridge bot between the two keeps the chats synchronized nicely. The conversations are active every day and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to professional work and co-op advice. You can also find us on Facebook as well.
