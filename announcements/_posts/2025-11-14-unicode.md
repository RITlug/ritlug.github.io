Hi all! This week, I'll be talking about Unicode and what you need to know to handle text
properly. As always, we'll meet from 4:30 - 6:00 PM in GOL-1445.

As a reminder, next week is **lightning talks**! Presentations may be about anything but they
should be fairly short (5-10 minutes). 

See you there!
