Attention All Penguins,

I hope you are all doing alright, and the new semester has found you well so far. But even with the semester starting up, and everything going on in the world right now, we hope you are all still finding time to Penguin about on your favorite distro of choice.

This week at RITlug we will be having a super exciting, and potentially pretty challenging, puzzle involving all your favorite shell commands. So whether your new to the command line, a Bash boi, or a even ZSH wiz, we are sure you will get a kick out the activity.

As a quick reminder, meetings this semester will all be taking place virtually on Fridays, 4:30pm - 6:00pm, via the new [Discord]({{site.social.discord}}). Feel free to engage with us there, or continue to hangout with us on [Slack](rit-lug.slack.com) as well.

I look forward to seeing you Friday! Stay safe, stay healthy.

Sincerely,
RITlug eBoard
