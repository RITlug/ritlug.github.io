Hey RITluggers!

Welcome to the halfway point in Week 8! Hope your October is full of Halloween fun, and if you're celebrating, happy Diwali!

RITlug is back again this week: this time, our secretary Allison Fox is our speaker for this week's meeting. We'll explore the history and legacy of women in the tech and open source communities.


### Women in Open Source

Last May, Red Hat and the open source community honored two exceptional women, Avni Khatri and Jigyasa Grover for the "Women in Open Source" award. This week, the RIT Linux User's Group (RITlug) looks into the history behind the role of women in open source and tech communities. We examine the invaluable and extraordinary accomplishments of pioneering women that changed the foundations of open source and are paving the way for future generations of women to do the same.

Our meeting starts at **4:00pm on Friday, October 20th, in GOL-2650** (large DB lab).


### tl;dr details

* **Day**: Friday, Oct. 20th, 2017
* **Time**: 4:00pm - 6:00pm

### Come hang out with us!

RITlug is in a variety of places, but the best way to keep in touch with the community is via the Telegram group and/or IRC channel. The bridge between the two keeps the chats synchronized. Conversations are active daily and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to co-op advice to random topics. You can also find us on Facebook as well (but not much is happening there!).
