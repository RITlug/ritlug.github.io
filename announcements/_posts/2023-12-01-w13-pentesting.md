Hey all! 

Hope you enjoyed your Thanksgiving break. This week we'll have a talk from Kyri about pentesting Linux systems. 

Also, the merch has arrived! We'll be distributing it during this week's meeting, if you can't make it to this meeting or the next let us know.

As always, we'll meet this Friday in GOL-1445 at 4:30 pm. See you there!
