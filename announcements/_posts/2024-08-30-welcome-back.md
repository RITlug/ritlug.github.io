Hello everyone, and welcome to the fall semester at RIT! This week's meeting will be a chance for new and returning members to introduce themselves, and for eboard to quickly introduce the club and what we do.

Due to a scheduling conflict, we have been moved upstairs this semester. We will be meeting this Friday and all subsequent Fridays in Golisano room 2455 from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM.

See you all there!
