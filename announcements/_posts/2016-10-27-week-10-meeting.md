Hey RITluggers!

This is a friendly reminder that RITlug will be meeting again this Friday (Friday, Oct. 28, 2016) from 4pm to 6pm in the GOL/70-2620 computer lab. This week's talk goes into a common term in the Linux world: LAMP. A LAMP stack often refers to a Linux, Apache (web server), MySQL, and PHP set up. This is a common configuration setup used for deploying various PHP applications out in the world. In this talk, you will learn more about what this is, how it used, and how to even set one up yourself.

Like before, since many people have classes that end around 5pm, we'll use the first hour (4pm - 5pm) as a workshop hour for anyone to bring their hardware, share projects, or get help with Linux topics. The talk will begin around 5pm.
