Hi everyone!

Welcome to week 9! This week although we have no offical topic, we will be doing a brief exploration of various distros. With all hope we'll be able to touch upon your favorites! This will be presented by our very own Pi expert Taylor Bowling.

Unfortunately I will be away this week, but Taylor has very graciously agreed to lead this weeks meetings in my absence.


##### Raspberry Pis!
Next week, Wednesday, **April 5th at 6:30pm** (after FOSS hours) there will be a meeting of the Pi group in room 70-2650. We'll be working on the magic mirror project as well as demoing the Pi Touch Screen! Please join us to have some fun with Pis!


##### FOSS Hours!
And lastly, don't forget about FOSS hours every Wednesday from **4pm-6pm in GOL-2500**! It's a great time to network, get help, or just relax with FOSSy/RITlug friends.

**This isn't limited to FOSS, RITlug members are welcome and encouraged to join.**
