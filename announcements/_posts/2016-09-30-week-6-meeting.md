Hey RITluggers!

This is a friendly reminder that RITlug will be meeting again today (Friday, Sept. 30, 2016) from 4pm to 6pm in the GOL/70-2620 computer lab. Today's talk will focus on a brief introduction of Linux. We'll cover some of the project background, what Linux is *exactly*, and also show examples of what Linux is being used for in the real world.

You can find RITlug this year in a variety of places, but the best ways to keep in touch with the club are via our Telegram group and/or the IRC channel. The bridge bot between the two keeps the chats synchronized nicely. The conversations are active every day and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to professional work and co-op advice. You can also find us on Facebook as well.
