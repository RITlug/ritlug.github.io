Hey everyone!

This week, we have a bit of a special meeting. This Friday is the meeting before RIT's career fair, so just like last year, 
we are going to have a few RITlug alumni (Jeffrey, Nate, Seth, and Tim) over to answer your questions about career fair,
interviewing, Linux in the corporate world, and anything else you might want to ask!

Due to scheduling issues, we will **NOT** be meeting in our usual room this week. We will be meeting in **Golisano 2455** (the same room
as last spring) at the usual time of 4:30-6:00 pm. We will be back to our usual room after this week.

See you all there!
