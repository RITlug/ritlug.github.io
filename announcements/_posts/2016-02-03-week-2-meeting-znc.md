Hey RITluggers! Welcome to week 2!

This week we will be having a talk about the IRC bouncer ZNC.

Many open source projects and communities communicate using IRC channels and many avid IRC users use an IRC bouncer, a proxy service that remains persistently connected to your preferred IRC networks and channels, instead of connecting directly to an IRC network. ZNC is one of these bouncer applications.

As usual, the remainder of the meeting after the presentation we'll open the floor to any further discussion on today's topic or other FOSS topics, technical help, and give you time to get your hands dirty.

If you have a cool project, know about something in the FOSS world that's super cool, or find a project or topic you'd like to hear more about, let us know! We'd be happy to schedule a week for you or someone you know to give a talk or try to work it into our schedule.
