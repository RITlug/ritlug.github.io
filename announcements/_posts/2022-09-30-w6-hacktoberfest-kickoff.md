Hey RITluggers! Next week we'll be kicking off Hacktoberfest (https://hacktoberfest.com/) which runs during the month of October. This year RITlug wants to get some club projects going, and Hacktoberfest is a perfect time to get started. If you have a project that you think would be cool to do, or one that you're already running that you'd like more hands on please feel free to email [eboard](mailto:eboard@ritlug.com) (or ping us on discord) and let us know. See you all this Friday at the usual place and time (4:30-6pm @ GOL-2620)
