Hi everyone, welcome to a new semester! The plan for this week will be to give introductions and for eboard to do a quick talk about Linux, FOSS, and what our club does.

We are also taking member feedback in regards to what types of meetings you would like to see and when we meet. Go to this form to tell us what we can do better <https://forms.gle/VNYEHKystLifFDZL9>

Join us in GOL-1445 from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM this Friday.
