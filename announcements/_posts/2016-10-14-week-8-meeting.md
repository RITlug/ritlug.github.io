Hey RITluggers!

This is a friendly reminder that RITlug will be meeting again today (Friday, Oct. 14, 2016) from 4pm to 6pm in the GOL/70-2620 computer lab. Today's talk covers an important feature in newer Linux distributions: Security-Enhanced Linux (shortened to SELinux). In the talk, we will cover some of the basics about what it is, where you can find it, and how it is used.

Since a lot of people have classes that end around 5pm, we'll use the first hour (4pm - 5pm) as a workshop hour for anyone to bring their hardware, share projects, or get help with Linux topics. The talk will begin around 5pm.

You can find RITlug this year in a variety of places, but the best ways to keep in touch with the club are via our Telegram group and/or the IRC channel. The bridge bot between the two keeps the chats synchronized nicely. The conversations are active every day and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to professional work and co-op advice. You can also find us on Facebook as well.
