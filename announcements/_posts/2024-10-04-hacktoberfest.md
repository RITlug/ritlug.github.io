Hello everyone!

This week will be a little bit different from previous meetings. This week we will be talking about hacktoberfest, an event that occurs every October to encourage contributions to open source projects. After a short presentation on how to sign up, the rest of the meeting will be free time to work on your own contributions to an open source project.

If you have ideas for a free/open source project that RITLUG members might be interested in contributing to, contact an eBoard member and we will include it in the slide deck for this week.

See you all there!
