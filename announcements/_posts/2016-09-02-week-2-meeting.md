Hey RITluggers!

Welcome back to RIT everyone! Whether you're a new student or a returning member, we're looking forward to another year of RITlug with everyone.

This introductory email has a few important announcements and information about the schedule this year. We'll also do a brief introduction of this year's eboard!


=== Meetings ===

The first meeting of the year will be September 2, 2016 (that's today!) from 4pm to 6pm. We will meet in GOL/70-2620 this year (different from previous years). Today's meeting will start with introductions, getting to know each other, and looking at what everyone's experience with Linux is. We will also have a guest speaker! After introductions, Charles Profitt, member of Linux Users Group of Rochester (LUGOR) and system administrator by trade, will be giving a talk titled, "Basics to Fedora Linux". If you're getting started with Linux and want to learn more, or if you want to ask an experienced sysadmin questions about the field, today will be a great chance!

As per usual, any time left over after the presentation and questions will be reserved as an open floor. If you've never been to a RITlug meeting before, the open floor is usually a time where we hang out and talk about various topics in Linux, free and open source software (FOSS), tech, or otherwise. It's also a great way to share some of your projects you might be working on with other club members.

For this semester, our meeting frequency will also be adjusted. We will meet every other week this year. This means our next meeting will be Friday, September 16, in GOL/70-2620.

Apologies on the late announcement for the first meeting. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we had to change our room last minute. I received final confirmation last night about the new room, which is why it took so long for this announcement to get out.

=== Member services ===

We're also hoping to introduce new member services for RITluggers this year! We have a new server installed in RIT's datacentr, and we want to know... what services do you all want or need? What would be helpful for you? Private git repositories for hosting your code? An IRC bouncer? A Nextcloud instance? Something else? Let us know! Come to this week's meeting with ideas about what kind of services you'd like to see (or let us know in Telegram, IRC, or Facebook)!


=== 2016-2017 Eboard ===

* President: Justin Wheeler
* Vice President: Solomon Rubin

This year, we will only have one member of eboard on campus at a time. I will be here during this semester for meetings and talks. Solomon is on co-op this semester, but will return in January. Hopefully you will all have a chance to meet Solomon before then if you have not already!

As a self-introduction, I am an open source contributor and member of the Fedora Project, one Linux distribution of several. I've been actively using Linux for the past three years and have various experience with different Linux environments. I am a Networking & Systems Administration major and enjoy running various services of my own in my free time. I'm particularly versed with open source communities as well.



Looking forward to meeting you all this semester! Feel free to reach out if you have comments, questions, or concerns. Keep the FOSS flag high!
