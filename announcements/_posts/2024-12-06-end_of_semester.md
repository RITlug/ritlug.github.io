Hi everyone!

With finals coming up, this week's meeting will be more focused on hanging out; there will be no talk today. As usual, we will meet today at 4:30 - 6:00 PM in GOL-2455. Thanks to everyone who came to meetings this semester, and an extra thanks to everyone who presented! 

See you there!
