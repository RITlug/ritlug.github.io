Howdy Window's Users!!

It's time to dive into windows this week! Everything you've ever wanted to know!

I kid. This week we're looking at Window's Sub system for Linux! A bizarre cross over between Windows and Linux. This is an awesome opportunity to teach folks who aren't quite as comfortable with Linux how it all works and how we can use it on something that we're all unfortunately familiar with. Even if you aren't a Windows users I think you'll find this interesting. Microsoft went to quite some lengths to get Linux running in their OS.
After the presentation (or full disclosure, this may be pushed until next week's meeting) we'll be taking my Windows Demo VM and trying to absolutely destroy it. Ever delete Windows32? Me either.


As always I'm looking forward to seeing everyone on Friday!

Don't forget about FOSS hours every Wednesday from **4pm-6pm in GOL-2500**! It's a great time to network, get help, or just relax with FOSSy friends.
