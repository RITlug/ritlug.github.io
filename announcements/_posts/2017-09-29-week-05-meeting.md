Hey RITluggers!

We posted posters, tweeted out a reminder, andâ€¦ forgot to send this week's announcement email, oops! We're back again this week, and this time, we're saving the world with free encryption, brought to you by LetsEncrypt and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) (EFF)!


### Save the world with [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and free encryption

Are your dreams haunted by a world without encryption? Do you envision a world of madness without HTTPS? RITlug has the answer to put away your nightmares.

Join us today, **Friday, Sept. 29th**, from **4pm to 6pm** to encrypt ALL the things with free SSL/TLS certificates from [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)! Learn what LetsEncrypt is all about and how you can use it to generate your own certificates for free.

This week's session is being delivered as a talk, but if you want to follow along during the workshop, make sure you **bring a laptop with you**.

##### Mini movie night

For a few weeks, we've talked about having a 20th anniversary screening of the movie "[_Hackers_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/)", a cult classic among American films.

> "_ This movie is about hackers who are blamed for making a virus that will capsize 5 oil tankers._"

Imagine, for a moment, that a Hollywood executive producer was tasked to write a film about "hackers" and computer science in 1995. All of the possible stereotypes and cringe-worthy moments are included in this awful film, and that's why it's so great to watch.

Sometime after the meeting, we will relocate to a different area to have a screening of the movie. If you're interested to watch with us, feel free to stick around for a bit after the meeting ends.
