Hi RITlug!

Welcome to Week 10! RITlug is back for another great meeting! â€“ here's what we're covering
this week:


### TigerOS Presentation and Demo

Join RITlug on **Friday, March, 30** at **4:30 in GOL-2620** (medium DB lab)
for an introduction to TigerOS, the RIT-focused Linux distribution targeted
at users new to Linux and RIT students, faculty, and staff.

TigerOS is a Fedora Remix aimed to bridge the gap between learning Linux, and
getting your work done! The main aspects include an RIT-themed design, software
selection based on specific majors, and more!

Today, we will be taking a look into how and why TigerOS was built,
difficulties we've faced, and the roadmap for future development!
