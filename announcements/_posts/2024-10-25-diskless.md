Drives? Where we're going, we don't need drives!

This week I'll be giving a presentation about netboot and diskless systems for virtualization and for clusters. I will be talking about PXE, and networked filesystems, as well as how to configure a Linux system to boot in such a configuration.

If any of that sounds interesting, join us in Golisano 2455 from 4:30 to 6:00 PM.

See you all there!
