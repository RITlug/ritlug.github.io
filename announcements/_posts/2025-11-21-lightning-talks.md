Hi all! The time has finally come for this semester's lightning talks! Anyone can come
with a 5-10 minute presentation about any topic they want -- Linux/software-related or
otherwise. No need to register in advance, just have your presentation ready to go. If
you made a slideshow but don't have a device to present with, eBoard will lend you one
of ours.

As always, join us this Friday from 4:30 - 6:00 in GOL-1445. See you all there!
