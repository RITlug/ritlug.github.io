Hey RITluggers,

This week we will be having a presentation from Kyri and Ryan outlining the basics of starting with Linux. This will include topics like how to choose a distro, or basic commands to get you up and running on a new system! As usual, we'll be meeting from 4:30-6P on Friday (Sept. 9) in GOL-2620 (same location and time as last week). We look forward to seeing you all there!
