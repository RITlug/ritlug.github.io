Hey RITluggers!

We're flying into Week 9 already, and October is almost over. Maybe you're
planning your costume, stocking up on candy, or trying to get your last few
contributions in for
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ "Hacktoberfest 2017 -
DigitalOcean")!
And this week, RITlug is here to help (with your hacks, not your candy).


### Hacktoberfest Procrasti-fest

Every year, DigitalOcean and GitHub partner up for
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ "Hacktoberfest 2017 -
DigitalOcean"). The goal? Make four contributions to any open source project on
GitHub in October. If you do it, DigitalOcean sends you free stickers and a
t-shirt to thank you for your work!

October is coming up to an end fast, and we want to help you earn your free
goodies. The meeting will be a hands-on, interactive workshop. Bring your
favorite open source projects and laptops, and we'll help you contribute and
submit your pull request.

Don't know of a project to work on? No worries! We have some projects ready to
show if you aren't sure what to work on.

Our meeting starts at **4:00pm on Friday, October 20th, in GOL-2650** (large DB
lab).

* **Day**: Friday, Oct. 26th, 2017
