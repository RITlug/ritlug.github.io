Hello Users of the Linux!

This week has been super busy! Career fair, Interview day (tomorrow), and for many of us exams! That being said, this is going to be a light week in terms of presentations. On Friday we'll be putting together an Arch install and going over the basics of Linux design. How we set up arch is up to you! My hands are at your command. It's also quite possible we try to remove core utilities and attempt to destroy Linux! 

Earlier today we had our first Pi Group meeting, which will be continuing every Wednesday after FOSS hours. Upcoming events for that will be announced over the course of the next week. We're looking at doing workshops and other Pi project work.


And lastly, don't forget about FOSS hours every Wednesday from **4pm-6pm in GOL-2500**! It's a great time to network, get help, or just relax with FOSSy friends.

Looking forward to seeing every one Friday! Good luck tomorrow if you've got interviews!
