Hey all! For those starting their first semester, welcome!, and for those returning, welcome back! Our first meeting will be this Friday, September 1st, at 4:30 - 6:00 pm. Our room for this semester has changed to GOL-1445 (with twice as many wall outlets as last year's!).

Our first meeting will start out with introductions, giving new and returning RITlug members an opportunity to meet each other. We will also introduce what Linux and FOSS are and give members an opportunity to show off their setups.

See you all there!
