Hi y'all! Welcome to the 10th week of classes. This week we're hosting a lightning talks meeting. Anyone can show up with a talk (5-10 mins) and present, on any topic you think might be interesting. So come with your best talks ready to go! Please remember to keep it school appropriate. See you all there!
