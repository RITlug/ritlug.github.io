Hey RITLUG! 

Welcome to Week 3! I hope everyone's classes are off to a great start. This week Christian Martin (ctmartin) will be taking a look into how to make your own self-hosted infrastructure from scratch. In this workshop, we will be creating a personal server that you can easily deploy yourself at home on a Raspberry Pi or a VPS (the cloud). We will also show you how to export thet VM you create so that you can take it home with you! As this is an interactive meeting, feel free to join us in this hands on activity! If there is anything specific you wish us to cover at this week's meeting, feel free to ping us on Slack (link below)!
