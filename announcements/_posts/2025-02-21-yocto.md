Hello everyone!

Yocto is a set of tools for building embedded Linux distributions. It includes tools for generating and composing system configurations, to automatically build a final system.

Tomorrow, Aria will be giving a talk about Yocto, so be sure to come if you're interested in embedded Linux.

See you there!
