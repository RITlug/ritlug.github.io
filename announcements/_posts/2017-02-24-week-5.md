Afternoon Luggers!

This week is a general meeting. As always, it'll be a low key time to come together, discuss projects and notable things going on. I've also got lots of stickers to give away!

Don't forget about FOSS hours every Wednesday from **4pm-6pm in GOL-2500**! It's a great time to network, get help, or just relax with FOSSy friends.

As always, I'm looking forward to seeing everyone tomorrow!
