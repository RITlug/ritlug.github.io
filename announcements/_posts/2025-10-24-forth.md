Hi all!

This week, Andrew will be giving a talk about low-level programming in Forth. We'll go
over a bit of history and what the language looks like, then look at a working
implementation and see how little it takes to write your own.

As always, we'll meet this Friday from 4:30 - 6:00 PM in GOL-1445. See you there!
