Hey RITLUG! 

I hope everyone is having a great week! We've got a fun talk planned for this week to get everyone ready for spring break. We'll be discussing the relationship between video games and Linux, including Linux-based game development, emulators, and much more. Also, for all you retro gamers out there, I will be bringing in my Nintendo Virtual Boy, which is a fairly rare 3D game console from the 1990s, for us to mess with.

Also, as we mentioned last week, we are looking to sell customized RITLUG jackets sporting our logo and customized with your last name. The custom jackets will cost $60, and if you're interested in purchasing one you need to let us know as soon as possible so we can put an order together. If you'd like to purchase a jacket, please contact one of our eboard members on slack, or email me personally at abstractaffairs@gmail.com. A picture of the jacket, without the custom logo and name, can be seen linked below.
