Howdy Luggers!

This is a precursor to this weeks email. Being mid-term week I'm running slightly behind,but rest assured there will be a talk this week. We've also got a new room (just across the hall!) that should allow a more collaborative meeting session. We'll now be meeting in room GOL-2520. Also, for those of you going, good luck at the career fair!

Tomorrow, Wednesday, March 1st, will be the first Raspberry Pi Group meeting, which RITlug is proud to be a part of. For anyone interested in the Raspberry Pi platform, including everything from basic setup to cool hardware and software tutorials, please stop by Golisano 2650 from 6:30 to 7:30 this Wednesday. We'll be giving an overview of the projects we want to work on this semester, including a Raspberry Pi powered Magic Mirror.

This will be run by club member Taylor Bowling! Both him and I hope to see you there!

More info about this weeks meeting will be sent out later this week.
