Hey RITluggers!

The election for RITlug's vice president in spring is now open; please [**vote
for a candidate](http://vote.ritlug.com "Vote for RITlug's next vice
president")** by **Friday, Nov. 11 at 4:00pm EDT**.



### Vote at [vote.ritlug.com](http://vote.ritlug.com "Vote for RITlug's next
vice president")

RIT released CampusGroups this past year, a new platform for RIT-sponsored clubs
to manage official business. This includes elections. The election for next
semester's Vice President opened on Nov. 3rd and will remain open until
**Friday, Nov. 11 at 4:00pm EDT**. Next semester's vice president will be
announced at our meeting on Nov. 11th.

We have two candidates for vice president.

* Tim Zabel (Tjzabel21)
* Christian Martin (ctmartin)

Please vote at [vote.ritlug.com](http://vote.ritlug.com "Vote for RITlug's next
vice president"). This URL redirects you to CampusGroups and you will be
prompted to log into your RIT computer account. If you have not joined the
RITlug organization in CampusGroups, you must join first before voting.

A final reminder will be sent this Friday.

Good luck to both candidates. I look forward to announcing next semester's vice
president at our meeting this Friday! As always, keep the FOSS flag high.


Cheers,
