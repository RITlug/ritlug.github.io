Hey everyone! 

This week, Tim will be giving a talk on the OSI model, autonomous systems, and the inner workings of the Internet. As always, we'll meet in GOL-1445 at 4:30 this Friday. 

Also, **lightning talks** are going to be on **November 17th** this semester! Anyone can prepare a short presentation (5-10 min) on whatever topic they want, be it Linux-related or otherwise, and present it at the club meeting. Presentations can be serious, but by no means have to.

See you there!
