Hi all! In no less than **6 days**, Microsoft will drop support for Windows 10. This Friday, we'll be hosting a Linux installation party! 

Whether you are using Windows 10 and unable or unwilling to migrate to Windows 11, just want to try Linux out, or want to help out others looking to switch to Linux, be sure to come! As always, we will meet this Friday from 4:30 - 6:00 PM in GOL-1445.

**IMPORTANT: Back up any data on your device before coming!**

See you there!
