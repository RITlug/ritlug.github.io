Hi RITlug!

This is the Friday of Week 10, which means nominations for the RITlug executive
board (eboard) are now open.


### Nominations now open

Nominations open today and close at the end of Week 11 (i.e. Sunday, April 8,
2018 at 11:59 PM EDT). Voting begins immediately after.

Running for eboard is a great way to help shape the future of RITlug. You will
work with other members to help run the club, work with projects inside RITlug,
and organize small events in the community.

The executive board of any student organization is a great way to demonstrate
leadership and teamwork on your resume too. Eboard members need to be organized
and efficient. They must also demonstrate good communication skills with others
on the eboard and with the club community. It can be a great conversation
starter for a future job or co-op interview.

**Please cast all nominations (for someone else or a self-nomination) by Sunday,
April 8, 2018 at 11:59 PM EDT.** Votes are collected in this form:

want to know more information, please reach out to me on Slack, Telegram, or IRC

As always, keep the FOSS flag high.

Cheers,
