Hey everyone!

It saddens me to say, but I'm going to have to put off the meeting today due to unexpected circumstances that have come up. I was unable to make alternative arrangements in time for the meeting. Instead, I have formalized plans to hold the "Open Source 101" meeting for December 2nd, 2016 at the usual time. This meeting will be themed all around various parts of FOSS, or free and open source software. The session will include a brief introduction to open source, a quick introduction to using common open source tools like git and GitHub, how to begin exploring open source, and some other unique opportunities to interact with open source at RIT. Part of the meeting will be a talk, with the remainder being a workshop for you to ask questions or dive deeper into FOSS.

I'm planning to open a wide invitation for this meeting as it will likely be the last meeting of the semester. A Facebook event is already created for the meeting. Feel free to RSVP and invite your friends who might be interested as well! The more people we have, the merrier.

I didn't expect to have to rearrange the schedule, but this should allow us to end the semester with a fun and engaging topic. I hope to see you all at the meeting! Feel free to reach out if you have comments, questions, or concerns. As always, keep the FOSS flag high!
