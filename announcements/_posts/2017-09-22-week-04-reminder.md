Hey RITluggers!

Just a quick reminder, the "Build your own virtual reality experience in an hour" workshop is today (Friday), from 4:00pm to 6:00pm (workshop starts at 4:30pm) in GOL-2650 (large DB lab). Come stop by for the session with guest speaker Christos Backarakis from Mozilla where we'll dive into the A-Frame framework!

This week's session is hands-on, so unless you want to use a lab computer, you may want to **bring a laptop with you this week**.


### tl;dr details

* **Day**: Friday, Sept. 22, 2017
* **Time**: 4:00pm - 6:00pm
    * Workshop begins at 4:30pm
* **Where**: GOL-2650 (large DB lab, 2nd floor of GCCIS)
