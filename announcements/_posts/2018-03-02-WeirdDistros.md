Hey RITLUG! 

I hope everyone is having a great week! This week's meeting is foing to focus on weird and wacky Linux distros, I'll be giving an introduction to a few of the strangest, most niche, distros out there. Stop by and learn about the finer points of famous distros like Hannah Montana Linux and North Korea's Red Star OS.

Also, we’ve been looking into designing club jackets over the past few weeks. We have a contact at a local company which has offered us a great deal on custom jackets, but in order to get this deal, we need to sell at least 12 jackets. The jacket we selected is a Port Authority Soft Shell jacket, which will have our logo embroidered on the left-chest, and your last name embroidered along the left sleeve. A picture of the jacket can be seen at the link below. Jackets will cost approximately $60, with a $5 donation to the club included in that price, as this will serve as one of our club’s fundraisers. If you are interested in purchasing a jacket, or would like more information, please feel free to reply to this email, or speak to one of our eboard members either in person, or on Slack. If you are interested, please contact us as soon as possible! Hope to hear from you soon!
