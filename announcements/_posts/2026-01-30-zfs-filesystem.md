Hello all!

This week, Jack will be giving a talk on the Zettabyte File System (or ZFS), a Copy-On-Write filesystem originally developed for Solaris with a number of interesting capabilities and features.  He'll go over the general organization of a ZFS system, the most interesting features, and how to install and use it (even as your root filesystem if desired).

As always, see you this Friday from 4:30-6:00pm in GOL-1445!
