Hello LUGers! This week we will have noted RITLug alum Justin Wheeler visiting us to talk about his experiences within the open source world within corporations like UNICEF, along with contributing to the Fedora project. Feel free to join us in room GOL-2620 at 4:30PM to come meet him and ask any questions about his experiences!
