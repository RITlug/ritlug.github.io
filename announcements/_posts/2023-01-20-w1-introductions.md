Hello everyone, happy beginning of the semester! As we begin getting back into the swing of things, it is time to start thinking about the first RITLUG meeting as well! The first meeting will be this Friday in **GOL-2455** (please note the room change! We no longer have our usual lab, we will now meet in this classroom, located across the hall from our old location) from 4:30-6p. This meeting will be purely introductory, so feel free to stop in and say hi/meet everyone if you haven't been able to make it to a meeting and would like to. We hope you all have a great semester and are beyond excited to see everyone again!
