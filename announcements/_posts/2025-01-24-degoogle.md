Hello everyone!

Are you sick and tired of Google spying on your every move? Are you interested in free and open source alternatives to the Google software that comes with your phone, or which you use for day to day tasks? Have you ever wondered what a "GrapheneOS" or a "microG" was? If so, this is the talk for you.

Come meet us at 4:30 today in Golisano 1445 to hear Freya talk about degoogling.

See you there!
