Hi RITlug!

Welcome to Week 11! RITlug is back again this week â€“ here's what we're covering
this week:


### Introduction to Swift programming language

Join RITlug on **Friday, April 8, 2018** at **4pm in GOL-2620** (medium DB lab)
for an introduction to the Swift programming language and community by Harlan
Haskins.

Swift is a landmark open-source project with hundreds of contributors and many,
many times more users. The Swift community is full of intelligent, insightful
users ready to contribute their voice to the project. Join Harlan and Robert,
two former interns on the Swift team, on a journey from checking out source to
closing a Swift bug report, live! Along the way, learn about core concepts,
tips, and best practices for effectively making your mark on the Swift project.
