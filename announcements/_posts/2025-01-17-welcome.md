Welcome back everyone! 

For our first meeting of the new semester we will be giving everyone a chance to (re)introduce themselves after the break. As such, there will be no talk.

This semester, we were able to reserve Golisano 1445, so make sure to go to that room at 4:30 PM tomorrow

See you there!
