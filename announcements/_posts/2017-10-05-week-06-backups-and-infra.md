Howdy RITluggers!

This week we have a special "guest" joining us remotely to give a talk on Backups and the Ritlug Infrastructure. Solomon Rubin, RITlug VP, (Serubin) will be teleconfrencing to share the ins and outs of how we do backups here at RITlug as well as general backup suggestions!
We'd love to also know how everyone handles their own backups so feel free to bring your homegrown solutions with you.

We hope to see you there tomorrow at 4!

### Come hang out with us!

RITlug is in a variety of places, but the best way to keep in touch with the community is via the Telegram group and/or IRC channel. The bridge between the two keeps the chats synchronized. Conversations are active daily and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to co-op advice to random topics. You can also find us on Facebook as well (but not much is happening there!).
