Hey everyone! This week's meeting will be a little different. This year's Hacktoberfest (https://hacktoberfest.com/), an annual event that encourages contribution to open-source software, just began a couple days ago. We'll start with a quick presentation about how to sign up and we'll spend the rest of the meeting working on contributing to projects. As always, we'll meet in GOL-1445 at 4:30.

If you have any free and open source software you'd like to share, whether it be club-related or not, you can contact an eBoard member and we'll include it in the presentation.

See you all there!
