April Fools Everyone! ... A few days late

This week we will be exploring and playing around with various goofy tricks and pranks on linux. 
It's pretty short and sweet as far as RITlug emails go. I hope to see everyone tomorrow!



##### Raspberry Pis!
Next week, Wednesday, **April 12th at 6:30pm** (after FOSS hours) there will be a meeting of the Pi group in room 70-2650. We'll be working on the magic mirror project as well as demoing the Pi Touch Screen! Please join us to have some fun with Pis!


##### FOSS Hours!
And lastly, don't forget about FOSS hours every Wednesday from **4pm-6pm in GOL-2500**! It's a great time to network, get help, or just relax with FOSSy/RITlug friends.

Next week we'll be having a guest speaker - see my previous email for more info!

**This isn't limited to FOSS, RITlug members are welcome and encouraged to join.**
