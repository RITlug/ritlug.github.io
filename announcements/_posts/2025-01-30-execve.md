Hello everyone!

Have you ever wondered how you get from a file on you disk to a process running on your computer? How shells work? How does they load, link, and run your programs? 

This week Tristan will be giving a talk about running programs.

Come meet us at 4:30 tomorrow in Golisano 1445 to hear more

See you there!
