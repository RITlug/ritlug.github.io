Hey RITluggers!

It's Week 14. It's the last week of classes and the _last week of RITlug_ this
semester. We know many of you are prepping for finals and getting ready for the
final stretch. This week, we decided to mix it up and try something new!


### Retro Game Night

Join RITlug this **Friday, Dec. 8th** at **4:00pm in GOL-2650** (large DB lab)
for our first-ever Retro Game Night! I'm bringing my GameCube, four controllers,
Super Smash Bros and Mario Kart. We'll set up the GameCube on the main projector
screen in the lab.

Do you have GameCube games or another retro console lying around? Let me know if
you have something you want to bring, and EBoard will try to find a way to set
it up in the lab.

We thought this would be a nice way to enter finals week. Note that this is our
**last meeting for the semester**. We will not meet on Dec. 15.


### tl;dr details

* **Day**: Friday, Dec. 8th, 2017
* **Time**: 4:00pm - 6:00pm
* **Where**: GOL-2650 (large DB lab, 2nd floor of GCCIS)
