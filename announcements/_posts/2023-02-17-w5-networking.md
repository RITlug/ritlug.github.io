Hey RITLuggers! This week we will be having a presentation from Preston regarding networking, everything from the basics to some pretty exciting and interesting emerging technology! We will be doing this meeting a bit differently this time around, this week we will be doing a hybrid meeting! Have you ever wanted to attend a meeting but couldn't attend in person? This is a chance to attend virtually! I've created a new stage channel #meetings under the Voice Channels. We will be live on Friday starting at 4:30p until the end of the presentation and questions. Please bear with us with any issues if they arise, this will be completely new to us. If it goes well, we may bring more hybrid meetings if interest exists!
