Hey all! This week, we'll have a presentation from Simon about the Win32 ABI. As usual, we'll meet this Friday at 4:30 pm in Golisano 1445. 

As a reminder, elections will happen on April 19th and lightning talks will take place on April 26th. See the previous announcement for more details.

See you all there!
