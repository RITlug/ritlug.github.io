Hey RITluggers!

Hope you all have had an excellent Week #3 so far. I'm enjoying my time out in some of this warm Rochester weather, for as long as it lasts!

RITlug is back this week, and this time, we're talking all about open source. Navigating the sea of open source can be challenging, but we'll break it down together!


### Open Source 101

Our next meeting is **Friday, September 15th, 2017** from **4:00pm to 6:00pm**. This week's topic is _Open Source 101_. In this session, you'll learn about the background and history of the open source movement and a bit about "why we FOSS". Then, we'll explore a version control system called **git**, why it's helpful, and a little bit on how to use it. Finally, we'll talk about how to join an open source community and things to look out for when choosing a project.

We hope to see you there for an exciting introduction to open source!


### Come say hello to us!

RITlug is in a variety of places, but the best way to keep in touch with the community is via the Telegram group and/or IRC channel. The bridge between the two keeps the chats synchronized. Conversations are active daily and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to co-op advice to random topics. You can also find us on Facebook as well (but not much is happening there!).

If you join, make sure to say hello and let us know you're here!

To make sure you're in the loop with what's happening with RITlug, make sure you're a member of our mailing list. This is the best way to receive future updates on what we're up to and where you can find us.
