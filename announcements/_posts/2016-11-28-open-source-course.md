Hey RITluggers!

As a reminder, this Friday (Dec. 2, 2016) will be the "Open Source 101" meeting! This meeting will be based on various parts of FOSS (free and open source software). It will briefly introduce open source, provide a quick introduction to some of the common tools of open source, and how to interact more with open source at RIT. If you're on Facebook, you can RSVP on the event page below:

Additionally, did you know that RIT actually has a minor in Free and Open Source Software? If you want a course on FOSS that also counts as a gen-ed elective and towards the FOSS minor, you can check out this course in SIS / Tiger Center!

* IGME 582-01 M-W-F, 9:00am-9:50am, Joe Anderson
* Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software Development
* Make open source content educational games for the developing world! (qualifies as gen-ed)

This course provides students with exposure to the design, creation and production of Open Source Software projects through educational game development. Students will be introduced to the historic intersections of technology and intellectual property rights and will become familiar with Open Source development processes, tools and practices. They will become contributing members of humanitarian software development communities such as the One Laptop Per Child and Sugar communities. Students will actively document their efforts on Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software community hubs.

Questions about the course? Send Professor Jacobs an e-mail: sj@mail.rit.edu
