Hey RITluggers!

Welcome back to campus for Week 13. We're in the home stretch! I hope all of
you enjoyed your time off, whether it was here in Rochester or at home with
family and friends.

This week, we're happy to welcome guest speaker [Charles
Profitt](http://hub.cprofitt.com/pages/about-me.html "About Charles Profitt") to
learn about the secrets of the data center!


### Linux and FOSS: Hidden in the Data Center

Join RITlug this **Friday, Dec. 1st** at **4:00pm in GOL-2650** (large DB lab)
to discover some of the secrets hidden inside the data center. Charles Profitt,
former lead of the Linux Users Group of Rochester (LUGoR) and IT professional
with over 20+ years of experience in industry comes to share the secret with us!

It used to be that data centers were ruled by big iron and proprietary
software. Today data centers are running on top of open source. In many cases,
the open source stack is hidden. We'll highlight several vendors that leverage
open source in their products.


### tl;dr details

* **Day**: Friday, Dec. 1st, 2017
* **Time**: 4:00pm - 6:00pm
* **Where**: GOL-2650 (large DB lab, 2nd floor of GCCIS)
