Hey RITluggers!

Welcome to Week 04. RITlug is back again this week, and this time, we have a special, hands-on workshop to dive deep into open source virtual reality in your web browser.


### Interactive workshop with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/ "A-Frame - Make WebVR")

This Friday, Sept. 22nd from 4pm to 6pm, join RITlug in GOL-2650 to build your own virtual reality experience in less than an hour! [Christos Bacharakis](https://bacharakis.com/ "Christos Bacharakis's blog"), a project manager from [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), is joining RITlug all the way from Greece to dive into the virtual reality world and more with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/ "A-Frame - Make WebVR"). Practice your git and HTML skills by building an amazing cross-platform VR experience for you to share with your friends. Yes, it's that easy!

This week's session is hands-on, so unless you want to use a lab computer, you may want to **bring a laptop with you this week**.

This session is also open-ended, so if you have questions about open source, Mozilla, or more, Christos is happy to talk to you about other things in the open source world after the workshop. We hope to see you there for an exciting introduction to web-powered virtual reality!

### Come hang out with us!

RITlug is in a variety of places, but the best way to keep in touch with the community is via the Telegram group and/or IRC channel. The bridge between the two keeps the chats synchronized. Conversations are active daily and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to co-op advice to random topics. You can also find us on Facebook as well (but not much is happening there!).
