Hey RITluggers!

Unfortunately, due to unresolved circumstances, today's meeting is canceled. I will be leaving for Boston early in the afternoon, and I was unable to have the room guaranteed without me present. I will also not be in Rochester next Friday, so this postpones our next meeting to September 30, 2016. This month is proving difficult to coordinate with planning - but I hope that we can resume the regular groove of meetings starting Sept. 30.

The bridge bot between the two keeps the chats synchronized nicely. The conversations are active every day and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to professional work and co-op advice.
