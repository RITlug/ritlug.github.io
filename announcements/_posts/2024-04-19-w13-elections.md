Hey everyone! This week is **elections**! Make sure to come to the meeting if you want to vote on who will be on eBoard next semester. It's also not too late to add your own name to the ballet!

After the election, Freya will be giving a talk on the history of the web and web development. As usual, we will meet this Friday in Golisano 1445 at 4:30 pm. See you all there!
