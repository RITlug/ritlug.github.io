Howdy RITluggers!

Almost time to head back to school and that means... RITlug is back! In case you were new or missed it, we have a slight change in leadership. Our beloved Justin W. Flory is headed to Croatia for the semester. In his place I'll be stepping in as President Linux Wizard. 

Our meeting time is going to stay the same - Fridays 4pm - 6pm in GOL/70-2620. I'd like to give a slightly different format to things this semester to increase our meeting time without overloading myself with work. Following a similar format as last semester, we'll only be doing talks on the even weeks (starting week 2). But, unlike last semester, on the odd weeks we will still meet in a more casual format. The odd weeks can be used to chat with each other about current projects we're working on, get help from one another on coursework or projects we can't tackle alone, or even for anyone to give lightning style talks on topics they'd like to share. 

Our first meeting will be Friday, January 27th at 4pm until 6pm in GOL/70-2620.

As always, suggestions and feedback is welcome and appreciated. And of course, if you have ideas on talks that you'd like to see or that you'd like to give please let us know! We want your ideas!

You can find RITlug this year in a variety of places, but the best ways to keep in touch with the club are via our Telegram group and/or the IRC channel. The bridge bot between the two keeps the chats synchronized nicely. The conversations are active every day and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to professional work and co-op advice. You can also find us on Facebook as well.
