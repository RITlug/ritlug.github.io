Howdy Luggers!

This week is a general meeting! We have a few things planned for everything and a few upcoming events that I'd like to share. First and foremost, this week is Brickhack! At this point if you planned on participating you should have signed up already but if you didn't that's arlight! You should still come by between Saturday and Sunday to the Clark Gym and say Hi! 
Second, this week we're going to start talking about RITlug projects and get some organiation out of the way for those. So far we have a MagicMirror project and the RITlug Distro project which both need team members. If you have a project idea, feel free to send me and email or find me in person and we can talk about it.

And lastly, next Wednesday (2/15) we are having our first FOSSTalk in the GOL Auditorium. It will be an open forum on Net Neutrality and the new Presidential Administration. There will be free pizza and drinks!

As always I'm looking forward to seeing everyone on Friday!

Don't forget about FOSS hours every Wednesday from **4pm-6pm in GOL-2500**! It's a great time to network, get help, or just relax with FOSSy friends.
