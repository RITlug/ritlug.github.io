Hello,

Hope your semester's going well!  This week, Joshua will be giving a talk on doing VR development in Godot, a well-known open source game engine!  Join us (in person) this Friday from 4:30 - 6:00 PM in GOL-1445.

If you have any talks you want to give, you should [sign up](http://present.ritlug.com)!  If you want a talk, but don't have the time/expertise, feel free to [suggest](http://suggest.ritlug.com) one instead!

See you there!
