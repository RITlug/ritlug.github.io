Hi RITlug!

Welcome to Week 12! RITlug is back again this week – here's what we're covering
this week:


### Open Source 101

Join RITlug on **Friday, April 13** at **4:00pm in GOL-2620** (medium DB lab)
for Open Source 101!

Are you curious about open source? What is it, really? Is it GitHub? Is it
Linux? In this session, learn what open source is all about and how you can even
get involved. You can get some resume boosters for yourself in the process too –
no experience required!

You'll never believe the two things nobody told you before about contributing to
an open source project.


### Elections now open

Nominations closed last night. The election for the 2018-2019 RITlug executive
board is now open. The election closes at 2:30pm on Friday, April 13. The
election is open to all CampusGroups members. Use the link below to cast your
