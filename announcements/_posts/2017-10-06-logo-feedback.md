Hey RITluggers!

Happy Friday! RITlug wants your help to choose a new logo for the club and you can have a say in our new design! Our logo is being redesigned by [Ura Design](https://ura.design/ "Ura Design - #OpenSourceDesign") and we are looking for feedback.


### Vote for our [new logo](https://github.com/RITlug/tasks/issues/3 "Look into logo redesign - RITlug/tasks")

View some of the new versions of our logo in [this GitHub ticket](https://github.com/RITlug/tasks/issues/3 "Look into logo redesign - RITlug/tasks"). Scroll down and you will see some of the proposed logo drafts. To leave your vote, here's what you have to doâ€¦

* **Add a :+1: rating** to any of them you like
* **Give a :heart:  rating** to your _one favorite_
* **Leave comments / suggestions** in the ticket for specific feedback

We hope to move forward on the logo redesign next week. Please log into GitHub and leave ratings on your favorite versions soon or add comments to the ticket if you think something is missing.


Don't forget that we have our [meeting on backups](http://ritlug.com/announcements/2017/10/05/week-06-backups-and-infra.html) today from 4pm to 6pm. We hope to see then! As always, keep the FOSS flag high.


Cheers,
- Justin Wheeler (jwheel)
