Hi everyone!

This week, we are doing lightning talks! Anyone is free to bring a 5-10 minute presentation about any topic they'd like - it could be FOSS/Linux related but does not have to. No need to let us know ahead of time, and if you need a computer or adapter to present we would be happy to provide one.

See you all there!
