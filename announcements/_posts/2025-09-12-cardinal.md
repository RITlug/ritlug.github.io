Hi everyone! Today I will be giving a talk about Cardinal, an open source platform for modular synthesis. Modular synthesis separates audio synthesis into individual components controlled by voltage signals. I will go over the basics so you can get started making sounds today.

Join us today at 4:30 PM in GOL-1445.
