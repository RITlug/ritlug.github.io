Morning Fellow Penguins! This week, we are going to have a very interesting presentation about Linux in IoT Devices. Come learn about how Linux is being used to power your smart toaster. The meeting will be the usual place and time, this Friday at 4:30pm - 6:00pm in GOL-2455! I look forward to seeing you all there!
