Hey RITluggers!

It's Week 11! And finally, snow is on the ground. We're continuing along towards
the end soon.

This week, RITlug's session covers the Haskell programming language!


### Freedom From State: Intro to Haskell

Join RITlug this **Friday, Nov. 11th** at **4:00pm in GOL-2650** (large DB lab)
to learn more about the Haskell programming language!

Haskell is a purely functional programming language, much different than C or
Java. But what is purity, and why does it matter? What does Haskell actually
offer for building software? And what in the world is a monad? Learn how Haskell
can change the way you think about programming. We'll cover some syntax, a
handful of demos, and discuss how Haskell's concepts apply to software
development!


### tl;dr details

* **Day**: Friday, Nov. 10th, 2017
* **Time**: 4:00pm - 6:00pm
    * Talk begins around 4:30pm
* **Where**: GOL-2650 (large DB lab, 2nd floor of GCCIS)
