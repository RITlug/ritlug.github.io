Hello!

Reinstalling and configuring an operating system takes *checks watch* a long time. Sometimes there's one setting that is either critical to your setup or breaks it. This week, Freya will be talking about declarative package management through Nix and Guix, how a declarative and reproducible system works, and how it fixes this!

As always, see you Friday at 4:30pm-6:00pm in GOL-1445!
