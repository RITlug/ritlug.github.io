Hey all! This week, I'll be presenting a talk about text encodings. As usual, we'll meet in GOL-1445 at 4:30 pm this Friday.

As a reminder, elections will happen on April 19th (the meeting after next). There is still time to run for election if you want to help run RITlug next year! See the Week 10 announcement for more information. Lightning talks will occur on April 26th - the final meeting of the semester.

See you there!
