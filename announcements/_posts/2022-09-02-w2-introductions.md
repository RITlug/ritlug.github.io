Hey RITluggers,

Welcome back to a brand new semester! We're going to have our first meeting this Friday, September 2nd in our usual room and time (GOL-2620, at 4:30-6:00pm). This week's topic will be introducing the club, new eboard, and all our members to any new people who joined, as well as quickly going over some Linux basics for those of you who are brand new to it. See you all there!
