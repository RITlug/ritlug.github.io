Hey RITLUG! 

This week we will be having a special guest. RITlug alum Nate Levesque (thenaterhood) will be giving a talk on Net Neutrality.
A short summary is below.
Telecoms are getting bigger and Internet service isn't as competitive as it used to be. Most big ISPs don't care about keeping the Internet open. Unless we fight for the Internet by making noise and contributing to projects that support net neutrality, we risk losing a major platform for free speech and open source. The future of the Internet depends on us.
