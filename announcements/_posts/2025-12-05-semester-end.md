Hi all. This week, we're holding elections for the positions of **Vice President** and
**Secretary**. Both positions are still open, so if you want to help keep RITlug existing
and have the time to spare, consider running for the positions (just message someone on
eBoard to let us know).

Other than that, this week's meeting will just be social time -- come to ask questions,
share what you've been working on, or study for finals together!

Join us for the final meeting of the year this Friday at 4:30 - 6:00 PM in GOL-1445.
See you there!
