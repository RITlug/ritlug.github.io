Hi RITlug!

Welcome to Week 9! RITlug is back again this week â€“ here's what we're covering
this week:


### Unify your local music library

Join RITlug on **Friday, March, 21** at **4:30pm in GOL-2620** (medium DB lab)
for an introduction to MusicBrainz, Picard, and how to make magic out of a music
library.

MusicBrainz is like the Wikipedia for music metadata. Companies like Spotify,
Amazon, Google, BBC, Last.fm, and more use MusicBrainz to maintain their own
music metadata databases. This hands-on workshop teaches you how to sort a music
library with Picard, a tool that uses the MusicBrainz database to correct
metadata in your own music.
