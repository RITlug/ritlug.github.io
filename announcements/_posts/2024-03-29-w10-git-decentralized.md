Hey everyone, a few things this week! First things first, I will be giving a presentation on how to use git "the linux way" (using email lists, raw text patches, the whole nine yards!) As always, we will meet tomorrow from 4:30p-6:00p in GOL-1445.

Second, we are coming up on week 13, which is historically when we perform e-board elections. As such, with this announcement today, we are opening up signups for running. Positions are held for one full year (a fall AND a spring semester) To run, you must have been a RITlug member for 2 semesters, so as long as you have been coming to meetings since the fall semester and you are going into your second year, you are eligible to run. Also, for treasurer, you must be physically present on Henrietta's campus during your tenure. You can run for the following positions (people running will be announced after signups close, in approximately two weeks).

- President
- Vice-President
- Secretary
- Treasurer

Contact anyone on e-board to nominate yourself for a position by Friday, 4/12. People running for positions will be announced that night and speeches/elections will occur in the beginning of the following meeting, on 4/19.

Third, we are announcing when the next lightning talks session will be! For the uninitiated, lightning talks are 5-10 minute talks from anyone about anything (school appropriate). Want to talk about esoteric technology? Go ahead! Want to talk about some random thing you know a lot about, even if it isn't strictly computer related? Let's hear it! It's a fun way to both talk about something you care about as well as build public speaking skills. If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, react to this message. It will be very helpful in letting us figure out how to split time between everyone, and it is by no means binding. Lightning talks will occur on 4/26, so there's plenty of time to come up with ideas!

Thanks, and see everyone tomorrow!
