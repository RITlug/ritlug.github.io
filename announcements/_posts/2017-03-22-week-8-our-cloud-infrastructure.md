Hi all!

Welcome back from break! I hope everyone is settling back into school nicely and that everyone had a nice and relaxing break. Now that we're back we've got tons going on!

##### FOSS Meeting today

Most importantly today is a FOSS talk! Today at **4pm - 6pm** we'll be visited by Nithya Ruff. Nithya Ruff has been a mover and shaker in FOSS for most of her career and is currently pioneering Open Source Practice at Comcast. This will be her second effort at leading the move toward Open in a major corporation, having completed a similar effort at SanDisk before moving to Comcast. She’s been an active board member of the Linux foundation for four years and a long-time champion of diversity in tech, most recently having become the Chairperson Diversity and Inclusion for CodeChix.
Among many other things, we'll be talking about how she is helping to bring FOSS to Comcast.

As with most FOSS events there will be pizza and drink and because of birthdays there will also be cake.
Please join us at **4pm in the MAGIC center room 1600**. Don't forget to register here: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fosstalks-bringing-foss-to-comcast-tickets-32264748732

##### RITlug

This week RITlug is going to be exploring our own server/cloud infrastructure. We'll be looking at what it consists of, how it operates, and how we want to better utilize it. In case you weren't aware; we do have our own RITlug server which helps to host services like our Telegram to IRC bot, gitlab, and number of other things. Lucky for us, we still have a lot of space on the server to use up, a big part of this meeting is going to be exploring what else wwe can do to make this server space useful. 

Looking forward to seeing every one Friday! Good luck tomorrow if you've got interviews!
