Hey RITluggers!

You're cordially invited to the sixth annual FOSS@MAGIC Election Night Hackathon on November 8th, 2016, from 5pm to 11:30pm in the MAGIC Center!

Watch the national and regional election results arrive in real time while you hack the night away on current projects or propose new civic hacking projects with new friends. With nine projectors, you will be able to watch the election night results unfold and enjoy the celebration of our 200 + year experiment in Democracy with the RIT community.

Pizza and other consumables will be provided. Please RSVP so we know how much to buy!
