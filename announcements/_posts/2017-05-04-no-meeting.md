Howdy folks!

Due to ImagineRIT this weekend there is no official meeting. However, our normal room will be open if folks want to hang out!

I will be sending out an email with election information tomorrow. Stay toned!

###### Imagine RIT
ImagineRIT is on Saturday! If you weren't aware, every year RIT hosts an amazing innovation fair and every year RITlug joins in the fun! We'll be seated at our own table in the Magic Center with Free and Open Source Software @ RIT. This year we'll be showcasing not just one but two magic mirrors, several Raspberry Pi's, and TigerOS! Along with all of our cool projects, we want to show all of our Imagine guests that Linux is awesome. Please stop by and visit our booth on May 6th, all day long!


##### FOSS Hours!
And lastly, don't forget about FOSS hours every Wednesday from **4pm-6pm in GOL-2500**! It's a great time to network, get help, or just relax with FOSSy/RITlug friends.


**This isn't limited to FOSS, RITlug members are welcome and encouraged to join.**


#### tl;dr 

* Time/date: Friday, April 5th, 2017, 4pm - 6pm (**GOL/70-2520**)
* Talk:  N/A.



#### Don't forget! 

You can find RITlug this year in a variety of places, but the best ways to keep in touch with the club are via our Telegram group and/or the IRC channel. The bridge bot between the two keeps the chats synchronized nicely. The conversations are active every day and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to professional work and co-op advice. You can also find us on Facebook as well.
