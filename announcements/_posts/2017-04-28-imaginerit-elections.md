Howdy folks!

I apologize for this late email. Couple of important things:

1) Due to a totally unpreventable ~~entirely my fault~~ technical issue, the election form was never correctly posted. It's now working at the same link. [https://goo.gl/forms/6VTNhHeuDcOIMWyW2](https://goo.gl/forms/6VTNhHeuDcOIMWyW2). This will be open until noon next Wednesday (the 3rd).

2) ImagineRIT is just a week a way! AHHHH. Given this we'll be talking about what's going on that day in terms of RITlug. Most notably, the current state of our projects.

Please remember to come visit us and hang out in the Magic Center on May 6th! I've left the plug from last week about Imagine, below.

Other than that, normal meeting, normal time, normal folks (okay, not really normal folks, but we can pretend.) Looking forward to seeing you all there!

###### Imagine RIT
In just a few short weeks is Imagine RIT! If you weren't aware, every year RIT hosts an amazing innovation fair and every year RITlug joins in the fun! We'll be seated at our own table in the Magic Center with Free and Open Source Software @ RIT. This year we'll be showcasing not just one but three magic mirrors, several Raspberry Pi's, and TigerOS! Along with all of our cool projects, we want to show all of our Imagine guests that Linux is awesome. Please stop by and visit our booth on May 6th, all day long!


##### FOSS Hours!
And lastly, don't forget about FOSS hours every Wednesday from **4pm-6pm in GOL-2500**! It's a great time to network, get help, or just relax with FOSSy/RITlug friends.


**This isn't limited to FOSS, RITlug members are welcome and encouraged to join.**


#### tl;dr 

* Time/date: Friday, April 28st, 2017, 4pm - 6pm (**GOL/70-2520**)
* Talk:      Elections, ImagineRIT.



#### Don't forget! 

You can find RITlug this year in a variety of places, but the best ways to keep in touch with the club are via our Telegram group and/or the IRC channel. The bridge bot between the two keeps the chats synchronized nicely. The conversations are active every day and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to professional work and co-op advice.
