Hello RITlug,
As promised I have created a whenisgood poll for working out a schedule for the TigerOS meetings. If you are interested in contributing to TigerOS, please add your availability to the poll. I will try to look over the results before the next RITlug meeting if the timing works and will let everyone know the times both at the regular RITlug meeting and via email.

#### Come say hello to us!

RITlug is in a variety of places, but the best way to keep in touch with the community is via the Telegram group and/or IRC channel. The bridge between the two keeps the chats synchronized. Conversations are active daily and there's all kinds of interesting discussion happening on a wide variety of topics, from Linux to software to co-op advice to random topics. You can also find us on Facebook as well (but not much is happening there!).

* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/RITLUG/

If you join, make sure to say hello and let us know you're here!

To make sure you're in the loop with what's happening with RITlug, make sure you're a member of our mailing list. This is the best way to receive future updates on what we're up to and where you can find us.
